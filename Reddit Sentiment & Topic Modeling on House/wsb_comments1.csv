RAndrewOhge,1339603108.0,,,t2_7zffy,"Tyler Durden - 23 May 2015
Earlier this month we learned that in 21 out of the 26 OECD member countries that have a minimum wage, working 40 hours per week at the pay floor would not be sufficient to keep one’s family out of poverty.
That rather stunning revelation comes as Democrats in the US push for a $12 minimum wage by 2020 and as pressure grows on companies like McDonald’s to raise wages for its lowest-paid employees.
Of course rising minimum wages can also have the rather counterintuitive side effect of harming those they’re meant to help because after all, when the cost of labor goes up, employers may simply fire people or, as we saw yesterday when McDonald’s pledged to reduce the number of company-owned restaurants by 10% over the next several years, resort to other measures aimed at getting around pay floor hikes.
So while one can debate pros and cons of addressing abysmal wage growth by legislating a non-market-driven solution, what is not up for debate is this: it’s getting harder and harder to subsist above the poverty line for low-income workers.
In fact, as the following map shows, in no state can a minimum wage worker afford a one bedroom apartment.
Here’s some color from a study by the National Low Income Housing Coalition:
Rents for apartments have risen nationally for 23 straight quarters.
As of the third quarter of 2014, rents were 15.2% higher than at the tail end of the Recession in 2009. Rising rents are an outcome of increased demand for rental housing.
One recent study of 11 major cities found double-digit growth in the number of renters in nine of the 11 cities between 2006 and 2013.
In the fourth quarter of 2014, the homeownership rate dropped to its lowest rate in twenty years and the rental vacancy rate fell to 7% as more households sought rental units.
The downward pressure on vacancy rates directly impacts the rental housing market, making landlords less willing to offer rent concessions and more likely to increase rents.
The tightening rental market has the most significant impact on low income renters.
So thank you Wall Street (and a hat tip to Alan Greenspan as well) for creating an entirely unsustainable housing bubble which finally collapsed on itself, turning a nation of homeowners into a nation of renters many of whom will now have to pony up everything they make each month to someone who may have gotten a landlord loan from Wall Street to buy up rental properties from home flippers who also got loans from Wall Street where some very clever investment bankers are busy securitizing these landlord and home flipper loans in order to sell billions in new ABS on the way to recreating the very same bubble only to have it burst all over again.

&gt; Until now, the most commonly cited information about SF housing prices had gone back to 1979, when the city started tracking the &amp;quot;Median rent of two-bedroom apartments advertised in the San Francisco Chronicle on one Sunday per year.""

&gt; That, my friends, is 70 years of San Francisco housing prices.

Re-roof will surely resolve, but is like a hammer to a molehill and only necessary if significant rot has spread through the structure.

Edit: re-read and noted you haven't purchased yet. Don't buy unless the previous owner rectifies the issue. The problems with roofing related problems is that there could be issues that are hidden until you strip back roofing sections so until the work is done (or invasive investigation) it is difficult to determine likelihood of success.

RAndrewOhge,1339603108.0,,,t2_7zffy,"In Berlin, A Model For Creative And Affordable Housing - Cities with vibrant arts, music, and social scenes are being hit hard by gentrification. But Berlin’s “co-housing culture” shows that a city’s future doesn’t have to go that way. By Sarah van Gelder - Apr 14, 2017| News Report

San Francisco used to be famous for its tolerant and creative culture. 

These days, it’s more famous for its astronomical cost of living; the average rent as of February for a one-bedroom apartment was $3,368. 

Cities with vibrant arts, music, and social scenes are being hit hard by gentrification. 

The pattern repeats itself in cities everywhere – artists, nonprofit leaders, young people, DIY culture, urban farmers, and small-scale entrepreneurs begin revitalizing a city. 

Then real estate speculators arrive, and before long the people who created the scene and many long-time residents find themselves priced out, leaving only the super wealthy – and the homeless.

But this isn’t the only future a hip city can have, and Berlin is a case in point. 

Anarchists for years have been squatting in abandoned buildings and on open land. 

Cooperatives and a variety of other shared living arrangements offer affordable options. 

Social movements have emerged to protect these approaches and to counter displacement of poor and middle-class residents.

While on a speaking tour of Germany, I visited Spreefeld, a housing cooperative built in downtown Berlin. 

The car-free community is located on the Spree River, but instead of reserving waterfront access for residents only, the creators included ways to welcome the public to walk through the grounds. 

Residents work closely with the neighboring squat called Teepee Land to facilitate public access to the river and to both communities. 

The co-op spent years convincing the city to allow a food forest along the nearby river walk. 

Co-op members hope the concept, if it works, can spread along other stretches of the walk.

The Spreefeld model comes from what author and urban planner Michael LaFond calls a “co-housing culture.” 

LaFond, founder of the Institute for Creative Sustainability, is an American living in Berlin who helped found Spreefeld and now lives there.

Cooperatives have a history reaching back to the mid-19th century in Berlin, LaFond told me. 

He estimates that as many as 250 or 300 squats have existed at some point since the 1970s in both East and West Berlin. 

Young people, especially anarchists, occupied vacant buildings as a way to live for little or nothing, and to save the old, beautiful buildings of Berlin from demolition in the name of urban renewal. 

The movement became powerful enough that city government was unable to evict people easily from the squats. 

Instead, city officials worked with the squatters to purchase the properties from absentee owners and offered funding to those willing to refurbish the buildings.

Many of these former squats are now cooperatives.

The founders of Spreefeld were influenced by this self-help culture and by the Scandinavian co-housing model that helped launch the co-housing movement in the United States. 

But the Spreefeld residents also brought their own ideas.

LaFond invited me to lunch in the common kitchen that serves the 21 units in his building.

“When you come home in the evening, there’s food on the table and on the stove,” he told me. 

“Often you’ll find people sitting here at the big table, and you can sit and talk and relax at the end of the day.”

The two lower floors in these buildings are devoted to community and public uses. 

There are office spaces for co-working, workshops, and galleries. 

A day care center attracts families from the neighborhood. 

Spaces for music, yoga, and dance are available to both community members and the public, as well as a kitchen, a large gathering space, and a woodworking shop.

Some parts of the building are designed to evolve as needs change. When the recent refugee crisis hit, residents converted two spaces into apartments to house two newly arrived families.

The residents here include teachers, health care workers, artists, and small-business and nonprofit managers, many of whom would struggle to find affordable housing if they didn’t live at Spreefeld. 

Some keep costs down by choosing tiny private spaces and making use of shared kitchens and bathrooms, while those with higher incomes look for ways to help cover expenses that might be a burden for their neighbors.

Berlin’s creative culture is under tremendous pressure as real estate speculators from around the globe buy up apartment buildings. 

But a culture of resistance and grassroots revitalization is putting a brake on gentrification, helping to protect the residents’ right to their city.

river-wind,1184890879.0,,,t2_27vr5,"You can rent an apartment as a green card holder - or even buy a house.  (My step-family are all green card holders).  Once you have signed a contract, you may be able to move in right away (if the apartment is already available; otherwise, you would start renting the 1st day of the following month).

You will most likely pay the first and last month's rent up front, as well as a security deposit.  At the end of your rental contract, if you have not broken anything in the apartment, you should get your security deposit back.  Regular wear and tear normally cannot be deducted from the security deposit - so if a landlord attempts to charge you for repainting the apartment, you can fight back.  If you break off the sink's faucet handle, they will deduct the cost of repairing that from the deposit you get back.

You could also purchase a house and not rent, but there is much more risk involved.  I would recommend against that in most areas of the US at the moment, as house values are generally fairly high, and the fees that go with buying a house would likely make it more expensive for the first year than renting would be.

river-wind,1184890879.0,,,t2_27vr5,"It depends completely on the landlord/the owner of the property, and on the laws of the State you plan to move to.  Your job offer will help, and the employer may have some resources via the Human Resources department to assist with relocation - including helping you find a place to live.  Finding a long-term rental in one day will be hard - it would be better to plan ahead. Do research via the internet, and see if you can find a month-to-month rental near your new job, with the plan to look for a new place once you have been in your job for a few months.

I have been a landlord in the US to one degree or another for 20 years.  When someone applies to rent my house or apartment, I give them back a basic rental application, which includes some basic questions such as:

*Prior living location with contact information for a reference
*Current Employment info with contact info, rough salary amount
*Anything I should know about (credit problems or criminal history)
*Permission to run a background and credit check

So long as they can afford the rent with their current job and don't have criminal history which they didn't disclose in the application, I'm pretty easy to work with.  If an applicant came to me with no credit history, as a landlord it would be very risky for me to accept them and let them rent a property.  That won't mean that you will get a no answer, but it does mean your monthly rent may be higher, to cover the extra risk.

That said, many landlords work with people who don't have a credit history, or have a poor credit history.  Especially if you are moving to an area with many immigrants, this will be a common issue, and more people will be familiar with how to handle it.  Talk to locals who have been through it to learn how to not be taken advantage of!  Learn the Tenant-Landlord laws for the state you are moving to, and know both your rights as a renter, and your legal responsibilities.

If you are approved, *read your lease agreement*, and if you know a lawyer, have them read it too.  Just because something is written down doesn't mean it is legal.  Make sure you and the landlord both understand what each is responsible for per the laws of the state you will be living in.  Be nice, be polite, but make sure they know you understand the process, and you will be less likely to be taken advantage of.  

Understand what a security deposit is, how it works, and what you need to do to get the money back when you move out.  Make sure the landlord is putting that money into an escrow account with both their name *and* your name attached to it.  Don't let them steal your security deposit if you don't break anything while living in the home - normal expected wear-and-tear almost never comes out of the security deposit.

Get renter's insurance.  It's not too expensive, but will cover any lost items in case the apartment burns down, and can potentially save you from a lot of difficulty should that occur.

In the US, a good credit history is very important to have - a good credit score can save you significant money.  Given your time frame, find a place to live by trying lots of places, be honest and up front and expect that some landlords won't talk to you without a credit history.

Then build a credit score so you can find a new, better, and hopefully cheaper place the next year!

http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2011/01/10/whats-a-credit-score-an-intro-to-credit-reports-and-credit-scores/

A method I've used to help some tenants improve their credit scores

1) Save $1,000  
2) Go to a bank and deposit that $1,000 into a savings account.
3) Get a secured loan from the same bank in the amount of $1,000 (the loan officer may be confused.  The key is that this will be a secured loan against the deposited money as collateral, so no credit check needed).  
4) Do not spend the loan money on anything else!  
5) Pay the monthly payments on the loan using the loan money.  Do not pay ahead.
6) In ~12 months, the loan is paid off (plus a bit of interest), and you get your original $1,000 deposit back.

If you complete that, you will have a much improved credit score due to paying off ""revolving credit"" on time.  Add to that having open credit cards which you use for some purchases during a month but are *never* late on paying back, you will be able to apply for a new apartment from a much better position than you are in when you start out.  Keep in mind that a good credit score reflects your potential as a low-risk money-making target for companies.  So being completely frugal and responsible (no loans, no credit cards, no rent or mortgage) can actually hurt your credit score.  The best score comes from lots of approved but unused credit (aka ""available credit""), and a perfect history of paying borrowed money and rent on-time.",0.0,1490898499,,0.0,dfm6dz6,t3_62cj42,1.0,t3_62cj42,39314.0,1491919187.0,1,,housing,t5_2qh7e,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But more than that, they’re happy to have beaten the odds in a region where  thousands are on waiting lists for existing affordable senior housing. With many new properties, you literally have to win a lottery to get in.

Jordan Pynes, president of Safran, said the company has built 3,000 affordable housing units in the last 11 years, mostly for seniors, and bought the Wilshire property in 2015.

“When we open a new property, we’ll have thousands of applicants for every unit available,” said  Pynes.

Wilshire Towers is a Section 8 building. Low-income tenants pay a little less than $300 monthly — one-third of their Social Security income — on rent. Market rates in the heart of Koreatown run much, much higher. But the project pencils out for Safran because a tax credit is available when you develop affordable housing, and Pynes said the company’s mission is to do good along with doing well...""",0.0,1484405924,,0.0,dcf1rbm,t3_5nxsb3,1.0,t3_5nxsb3,73.0,1486042651.0,1,,housing,t5_2qh7e,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No, you should not be expected to pay anything back. These aren't loans, here's the main types of affordable housing:

-public housing. Owned and managed by a Public Housing Authority (local or sometimes state government agency). Requires that tenants have a certain income to maintain affordability. You generally pay 30% of your income towards rent.

-housing funded by low income housing tax credits. Private developers  receive tax credits from the government in order to build a residential development. The money comes with a land use restriction agreement--for a certain number of years, the development will have to keep a certain % of apartments at a certain rent. The rent is based on local median income, so if the development is in a nice area they might not be all that affordable, to be honest.

-Section 8/housing choice voucher. Administered by public housing authorities or occasionally other government agencies. This is a voucher program where the government gives you a subsidy to use towards rent at any place the landlord is willing to accept the vouchers. These have maximum limits and certain requirements for the apartment. Section 8 typically has waiting lists that are reeeaaally long.

Those are the three big ones! There are many others as well, but these are the main ones people are talking about with ""affordable housing"". For any of these programs, you pay the subsidized/lowered rent and that's it. No paying extra later. 

I also just wanted to say you should definitely know your rights. Look for a low income housing advocacy or fair housing organization in your state/area and see if they have a pamphlet on renters'/tenants' rights. Know what people can and cannot do to you. Know what you owe and when. Management at these places can be a bit rough so be your own advocate. It's not all doom and gloom but I've heard some horror stories working where I do!

Hope my ramblings are helpful!

No, living in low income housing (I assume you mean public housing?) will not affect your career. These resources exist for a reason, there may be a bit of a stigma around public or assisted housing culturally but that's about it.

As for being 'charged later', not sure what you mean by that. There are lots of types of low income housing--public housing (owned and operated by a housing authority), units funded with low income housing tax credits, units funded with other federal state or local housing programs, and there's a lot of plain old rent assistance programs as well. A lot of low income housing is actually privately owned and managed but with requirements for the income of the tenant to maintain affordability. You should reach out to the state housing agency where you plan on moving and even the city/town where you plan on going to find out about these programs locally. Look online, they may have a list of all the units they've funded through these programs. If government doesn't help, there's also a load of private (nonprofits usually) sources for housing assistance.

BTCisaBUBBLE,,,,,"Harlingen, Texas

As the tough economic times continue in the U.S., many people are looking to cut down on their expenses by moving to more affordable cities and towns. But where to go? The Council for Community and Economic Research, a nonprofit group that provides information on local economic trends, recently compared the cost of living in 306 urban areas in the U.S. Based on the price of housing, utilities, grocery items, transportation, health care, and miscellaneous goods and services, here is a look at the least expensive cities around the country to live in.

The town with the nation's lowest cost of living is Harlingen, Texas, located in the state's southernmost tip and with a population of 74,950. The after-tax cost to maintain a standard of living enjoyed by the average company manager or other professional is roughly 17 percent lower than the national average. A pound of ground beef in Harlingen costs $2.35, compared with $3.30 nationally as of January, while a night out at the movies will run you $9. The average price of a home is $229,558.",,1514300804,,,drs08w6,t3_7fnw42,,t3_7fnw42,,1514300809.0,1,,housing,t5_2qh7e,,False,,,,,,/r/housing/comments/7fnw42/my_girlfriend_and_i_are_looking_to_move_to_a_city/drs08w6/,,,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",1514300809.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2. Once identified - look into local building regulations/costs/bulding permits. How ""easy"" it is to build there. If not easy go back to #1.

3. Put together financial plan: how much will everything cost. Use national averages as a rough guide. For example: national average to build 1sq ft = 150$, you can of course target different costs per sq ft but you need something to use as a rough guide.

3. Obtain house build plans, talk to a building architect who can go over your plans.

4. Secure finances.

5. Establish project plan

6. Go for it!

The median sales price of a home in the US is about 300k. This article says if every home dropped 7%, only the wealthy would feel the pain. Bullshit. The average homeowner would be crushed if they lost $21,000 in equity. The average wealthy individual would not be affected in the same way, not even close.

Having the rents pay cash then selling to you will raise some eyebrows on the mortgage side, because it’s no longer what’s called an “arms length” transaction. This can limit your loan to value (LTV) to 85%, meaning you’ll have to have 15% of your own money in. There may be transfer taxes and extra title fees/closing costs as well. 

Without knowing details, it’s hard to direct you one way or another.

What I can say definetively is that though they are polite and more or less easy to deal with I wouldn’t recommend renting from them. They raised my rent 30% + in 2 years (and this is with me negotiating the first time, they wouldn’t allow it the second year). Being a good tennant isn’t something they value. Not that I blame them, it’s giant company out for profit but as a tennant you know your time is limited. Getting them to do service means you have to take away time from work because they only do work from 8-4 and require an adult to be present. All the service done on the house was fast and only the minimum got done becuase they don’t care that much about upkeep of the homes since they bought all these homes at the bottom of the market and stand to take huge profits now that the housing market has more or less recovered. If you’re living in an area where the real estate market is moving fast (which you probably are because that’s where they did most of their buying) it’s likely you’ll be getting huge rent increases year over year.

My credit isn't great, since I'm a little too good with money, so I never saw a need to get a credit card and spend money I don't have. which means I've got pretty weak credit.

Yeah, I feel a little reluctant about mentioning any physical issues to potential employers, because I know that just because they're not supposed to discriminate against someone doesn't mean there's any way to prove when they're doing it. I wouldn't need any accommodations wherever I lived, and I would just mention it to places that are only for people with a disability or are elderly, so that would just give me more options as I otherwise wouldn't even qualify to apply there.

I would not recommend you ask to be disabled, unless you actually need to make adjustments to the property to make it easier for you to live, at least in DC, those with disabilities were the victims of the most housing violations of any demographic, because people refused to let tenant make necessary adjustments to facilitate the disability. It sucks. 

I would put the HCVP stuff on hold and focus on: improving and maintaining good credit worthiness, finding a place to stay, etc.

barrym_54,1521822780.0,,,t2_12zve5il,"Thanks a lot. So I take it I would have to go through this whole voucher system before I could even get into any of these places that offer section 8? This whole system sounds confusing to me, and right now I'm taking a calculus course. This is what it says in the city where I live (and unfortunately I can't live anywhere else since I need close access to my local community college, as the only other locations never offer the classes I need):
*Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher waiting list is currently closed. It was last opened in 2011 and prior to that, in 2008. As of June 2014, voucher recipients are still being selected from the 2008 waiting list.*

*Last Updated on 07/20/2015.*

So it sounds like I might not hear back from them for another ten years. I'm not sure if these places have an application fee since I was already in the apartment complex when that realtor bought it, but if not should I just apply anyway and see what happens?

muieenLNF,1519825258.0,,,t2_z7hqkvr,"I deal with a lot of HCVP (Housing Choice Voucher Program) in DC, which used to be Section 8. The way it works is you go through application process (can take x years). Then the local government (in my case DCHA), will grant you a voucher if you qualify. Now for Dc, you can only apply the voucher to properties that are Below the rent maximum for that neighborhood. So in DC, you would have to consult this site: http://www.dchousing.org/rent_hcvp.aspx to let you know what max rent is for each neighborhood. 

From there you apply to those places. If your credit is above a certain amount then you are able to get in. Specific to DC there are very few reasons you can deny a tenants application without it being considered discrimination. 

Now here’s where things get complicated DCHA, the landlord and tenant have to figure out a crapload of paperwork and inspections. The inspections require the property to be at a very high level of quality, which you can find on DCHA’s website. After like a month of all that tenant finally gets in, tenant pays a max of 30% of their income. 

Other parts where things get messy. Some people who get awarded a voucher have failing credit of below 600 (from my experience landlords refuse to rent out to those with credit scores below 600). The reason for that is that the tenants still have to pay utilities. If they miss utility payments for things like water, DC water can actually put a lien on your property because the tenant did not pay. Creates a headache of a situation which is why most landlords refuse to below a certain credit score. 

Other things that make it a mess, there’s very little coherent information of DCHA’s website to really explain the HCVP process so I don’t know what’s going on, and no one seems to know what’s going on.

interstellar-blue,,,,t2_31vkm1jp,"There are a few standards out there for determining a mortgage loan you’d be qualified for. Most fall in the range of 2 - 3 times your annual income, or simply ensuring that your monthly mortgage payment doesn’t exceed 30% of your monthly income. So, for one, it depends on how much money you make a year. Based on your submission, it doesn’t sound like you make much at all. ~$1,200 a month is less than $15k a year. If a $30k - $45k house exists, it’s cause it’s in shambles. As it stands, you can’t afford more than ~$400 a month for housing. That’s a tiny budget. 

Aside from this, banks use credit to determine their risk in lending you money. Without that, I doubt you’ll get a mortgage the conventional way, unless you find a high risk lender who will give you a super high interest rate and 0% down — which I don’t recommend. You can’t afford a house as it is based on the numbers above. Plus, with no renter’s history, that makes a lender even less likely to loan you anything. 

You’re better off renting a room or having a live-in job. In other words, getting a job that provides you housing on-site. There are both paid and volunteer sources that do this. Otherwise you may need to bunk with a friend. Sorry dude. I make $30k and can’t afford a house.

Raillerie,,,,t2_3kdarx4e,"This question in and of itself is very complicated. Deciding to own a home is a huge responsibility. Whether or not it’s a good idea to buy depends on the area that you live in. We’re currently in a sellers market which means Home values are overinflated. We could be looking at another crash in the next 5 to 10 years. I personally wouldn’t buy property right now. But, it is true that when you rent you’re basically giving your money to your landlord.  But in return you don’t have to do maintenance on the home that you live in. From personal experience homes can be extremely expensive to maintain. Especially if you can’t afford to buy one that’s already been remodeled.  I would answer the following questions then make a decision.

1. Do you have 20% of home value to put down?
2. Do you have not only the monthly payment, but also enough to cover the taxes and insurance on a home?
3. Are you knowledgeable enough to do your own home repairs?
4. If you are planning to buy a fixer-upper, can you do those improvements yourself?
5. If you don’t have the skills to do those improvements yourself, do you know enough to supervise your contractor?
6. Are you OK giving up your free time to maintain your home?
7. Are you secure enough in your job that there is no risk of losing it should the economy turn?

My husband and I have owned our home for around 15 years, we have done extensive improvements on it. I can say it’s been extremely expensive and time-consuming, even though my husband knows how to do the work himself.  We have hired contractors to do some work for us, but unfortunately if my husband had not been knowledgeable enough to spot errors, there would’ve been a lot of things done wrong.  Our first remodel project was a complete gut and redesign of the kitchen.  We did 90% of the work ourselves and it cost us around $35-$40,000. Had we hired somebody to do it it probably would’ve been twice that.  I’m not saying home ownership is not worth it in the long run, but like any investment, it should be viewed from the long term (20 years or more).  When you ask “how long should we stay in it?” That’s not an easy question to answer, generally you have to stay in a property for three years in order to avoid paying capital gains taxes on any value above the purchase price. But of course he would have to talk to your tax accountant about that.  I would recommend buying with the plan to either stay in the home and improve it over many many years in order to sell closer to retirement.  Or buy something you can live in without improving. Yes an unimproved home will go up in value over the long run but we’re talking at least 10 years if not more depending on home values in your area.  And even if you plan not to do major home improvements there will still be fix-it projects and maintenance. Toilets break, electrical goes out, plumbing leaks, flooring gets damaged, etc. you will still need to plan for unexpected maintenance.

Just go into buying a home with open eyes.  Home inspections before purchase certainly don’t catch everything. Inspectors can’t see the electrical or plumbing behind the drywall, or what might be hidden by carpet, or a new coat of paint.  Be your own advocate.  Hope this helps!",,1561393372,,,erxttrl,t3_c4huiq,,t3_c4huiq,,1561393374.0,1,,housing,t5_2qh7e,,False,,,,False,True,/r/housing/comments/c4huiq/buy_vs_rent/erxttrl/,True,,{},1561479772.0,,,,[],,,text,,,[],False,False,0.0,,,,,,,,,

I-Downloaded-a-Car,,,,t2_hwveh,"TL;DR The green space is the reason for the circles. If you built square plots the same distance from the road as these are it would take more area to build these houses than there is total land in this picture. The rest of this post is just an explaination for how I figured that out.

I'm not an architect, so I'll just start off by saying that. However, I found this interesting so I'm going to try my best to come up with some semblance of explanation.

Firstly let's establish scale. It doesn't actually matter but it is nice to have a frame of reference to go off of. If my knowledge of vans hasn't failed me [the white van right here](https://imgur.com/0P27jqC) is a Mercedes Sprinter, 20 feet long. This is backed up by the width of the road being about the same as the van, 20 feet is a reasonable width for a path like this one.

That gives us an established scale. To avoid the perspective warping the numbers all further measurements will be done on the bottom right group of houses. It is assumed that all plots and all circles are the same.

Each circle has 16 houses in it. each plot is about 7 vans long and 2.5 vans wide at the base. (50 feetx140 feet). The plots are close enough to isosceles triangles that we can use that property to do the calculations. A = 1/2 * B * H. A = 3500 square feet. So now we know each plot has an area of 3500 square feet. If there are 16 houses per circle each circle has an area of 56,000 square feet. There are 9 circles so the total plot size of everything is 504,000‬ square feet. The rest is green space.

there are a total of 171 houses shown in this picture, each with a lot size of 3500 square feet. This lot size wouldn't work very well if these were square lots because that would mean the plots could only be the square root of 3500 or about 59 feet per side. Because these houses are on triangular plots it is instead possible to set them back an entire 140 feet from the road, while still only sacrificing 9 feet of spacing between each house. The circular design also allows for the houses to all have some amount of green space behind them, instead of having a road or more houses.

Let's suppose you want to build these on rectangular lots but you also want to have the same 140 feet of offset from the road. To do that you'd have to give every single house 7000 square feet. Or exactly twice what they take right now. Resulting in a substantial amount less green space. Let's figure out how much green space that would give you now. To do this we'll use the bottom two circles.


[If you draw a box around the bottom two, starting at the highest point on the left side](https://imgur.com/X8ieO4V) and ending at the bottom of the image you'll find that it's 35 vans x 20 vans, 700 square vans, or 280,000 square feet. To get an accurate picture of the exact size of the circles I'm going to measure all the way into the middle of the driveway instead of the end of the lot. That produces a measurement of 8 vans. 160 feet. So the radius of our circles is 160 feet. πr^2 = 3.14*160^2 = 80,384. 80384*2 = ‭160,768‬ square feet for both circles. That leaves us with 119,232 square feet of green space for those two instances, or ‭42.58‬% of the area is green space. Now obviously we can't build 50x140 square lots on the amount of land. It would take approximately twice as much land to do that, going off the lot sizes we determined earlier. That would be‭ 321,536‬ square feet required to build the houses with square lots. Or 12.92% more land than is currently being used for both the green space and the houses.",,1560743132,,,erdigpk,t3_c0uxpy,,t3_c0uxpy,,1560743133.0,1,,housing,t5_2qh7e,,False,,,,False,True,/r/housing/comments/c0uxpy/why_are_these_houses_distributed_in_this_way/erdigpk/,True,,{},1560876538.0,,,,[],,,text,,,[],False,False,0.0,,,,,,,,,

Everyone tries to move in the Spring/Summer months (student season, etc.).

That being said, look for later on in the summer (July/August) when prices might start dropping (rental prices can change pretty often). Companies will definitely start to offer promotions to get people into units too: first month free, gift cards, a few months free parking, etc. I would keep tabs on specific buildings/areas you want to live.

alliemcee,,,,t2_4d4bf,"Whelp, the way i see it, you've got a few negotiation tactics. 1) You TELL your landlord what you can pay for this month (in this case, I would lowball your offer) and you base this $$ number on what you've got in savings and what income you're expecting. Keep n mind that this rent negotiation may be an haphazard/ad hoc agreement that can and will be uphelp in eviction proceedings, should it come to that. (ie 120 days from now: I lowered your rent and you still didn't pay it!) so make sure you come up with a number you can sustain for 3 months.

The other tactic is to sit and wait. 2) Keep as much money aside for rent as you can (buy money orders, they're harder to spend) and wait for the landlord to ASK FORCEFULLY for it. This case really depends on what (if any) consumer protections your state government has enacted. If we assume you can't currently be evicted, your land lord will either reach out to you or wait until the eviction rule is lifted and kick your ass out. Either scenario goes smoother if you talk to your landlord about payment plans IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE TO LIVE THERE. 

No matter what happens, you're best chance of survival is relationships. if you haven't/can't/won't built one with your landlord, make sure you've got others you can call upon.

igankcheetos,,,,t2_6jx39u7k,"First off, congratulations on purchasing a home. It is very exciting and a little bit scary. I would like to impart some advice to you that I wish was imparted to me when I was purchasing my home.

You should stop using your credit card until your home purchase goes through and keep it at a zero balance. Even after, you should try to pay it to zero every month because it is the most expensive way to pay for anything. I know it is rough to make ends meet sometimes. I just finally caught up on my own credit card debt, but it really is the most expensive way to pay for anything. Also, it might be tempting to remodel your house or update it or buy new furniture on credit as soon as you move in. 

Don't do it. Be smart with your money. Give someone else's unused things new life. Craigslist free stuff saved my life in this regard. 

You will almost always encounter unexpected expenses in the first year of your home ownership, (I had to pay 10 grand for a sewer lateral replacement that I didn't even know about) and also don't forget to set aside extra money for taxes. Even if you have an escrow account, save up extra because they will be calculating escrow on the old tax rate. You WILL receive an adjustment bill and depending on your new tax basis, it can be several thousand dollars more than you expect. 

My gut says that when purchasing a home, you should have double the down payment (40 percent) cash on hand. You should put 15-20 percent down and retain the rest in a separate account that you will not touch for except for unexpected expenses regarding your home. Coming up with the down payment itself can be hard for people, and coming up with double is even more rough, but being prepared for contingencies is worth it.",,1590871383,,,fscn0aq,t3_g3slun,,t3_g3slun,,1590874979.0,1,,housing,t5_2qh7e,,False,,,,False,True,/r/housing/comments/g3slun/payoff_credit_cards_question/fscn0aq/,True,,{},,,,,[],,,text,,,[],False,False,0.0,,,False,[],,[],,,
igankcheetos,,,,t2_6jx39u7k,"People buy investment properties to expatriate their wealth (mostly from China) because it is easier and less risky than smuggling a cargo container full of cash and trying to deposit it by the truckload into foreign banks. These folks buy real estate because it offers a solid return on their cash and is relatively more stable than other investment interests. These do not want to become landlords. They are just looking for a low risk place to park their wealth. The side effect of that is that they have massive amounts of vacant residential properties and they drive up the cost for everyone else because of the most fundamental economic mechanic (Supply and demand) of housing. The best way to combat this practice is to apply a vacancy tax to make investing in vacant real estate unprofitable. This way they can hire a management company to rent out their vacant units to avoid the tax and provide more downward pressure on rent prices by increasing housing supply. Utilizing tax, nobody is \_forcing\_ them to use their property in any way, but they are making it financially detrimental to utilize their properties inefficiently.",,1590870002,,,fscj78t,t3_g3vwea,,t1_frwalrn,,1590873288.0,1,,housing,t5_2qh7e,,False,,1590870225.0,,False,True,/r/housing/comments/g3vwea/residential_vacancy_tax_in_san_francisco/fscj78t/,True,,{},,,,,[],,,text,,,[],False,False,0.0,,,False,[],,[],,,

I had a combination of both long-term rentals and Airbnb 

I have a 4-unit where all four units had long-term tenants in a very centrally location in Washington DC

In 2014 I decided I wanted to have an Airbnb but knew that condos don't allow leases less than 6-months. I was a large porcentaje of listings on Airbnb were illegal to start but in DC most buildings don't have doorman so no one except neighbors could tell.

So I found a TH I could divide into 2 units . The basement would be Airbnb

The tenants in basement of the 4-unit left so Dec 2014 I furnished the 2BR/2FB 900SF basement. I thought there would be very little interest for a 2BR but I was wrong. 

The 2-unit had long-term tenants upstairs that paid 90% of mortgsge and property taxes. The Airbnb was extra 

So for 4 years had 2 Airbnb and 5 long-term tenants in DC . But in Jan 2019 tenants upstairs left so I turned the upstairs into an Airbnb. Spent $7K furnishing and in one month got back all the investment. We moved out of our unit in the 4-unit so now we had 4 Airbnbs.

I moved into this apartment complex April, 2016.  I chose it because it is on the river and had a dock for my boat.  I've not been able to keep my boat here since December, 2016, because it is not safe. My boat almost sank at that time, and I'm now keeping it down river about half a mile away.  It was situational; I don't hold the apartment complex responsible for my boat.

However, when I moved in, the grounds were well kept and had beautiful landscaping, a riverside pool, etc.  Shortly after I moved in, they began major renovations, including the removal of all landscaping (bushes, trees, etc.), so there is no longer any landscaping.  The pool is always out of service.  They've been replacing water lines for months, which has lead to constant inability to use the common areas in addition to constant flow of water that has resulted in tremendous mold.  If I require immediate service (i.e., air conditioning is out, flooded carpet from leaking toilet, etc.), I'm unable to get assistance because the maintenance team has no English speaking people available.  That's not a racial issue; it's a communication issue.  I could go on, but I'm irritating even myself with the details.  Sorry.  

Many of my neighbors have already left because it has become so bad.  Others, like me, are merely waiting for our lease to run out before getting out.  That's why it almost seems like good news that I'm being evicted, if that means my lease is terminated early.  

I'm not poor.  I can afford a better place.  I only chose this initially because of the boat dock.  There aren't other waterfront rentals available and I don't wish to purchase a place right now.  But, I don't need waterfront since I'm keeping my boat elsewhere.

Again, thanks for your assistance.  I don't know where else to turn right now. I'm a widow (not a crutch or excuse) and things are just kinda effed up.",,1506744258,,,dnpdct2,t3_739zkb,,t1_dnp9ynu,,,1,,housing,t5_2qh7e,,False,,,True,True,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An eviction will be bad, whether you are worried about it currently or not.

How much longer is your lease?  Why is it unbearable?  Do you owe any back rent?  Has your landlord broken terms of the lease or Florida law in any way?  Then you'd have your escape clause without needing to be evicted.

Look up an Addalock on Amazon. It's a lock you put in between the door and frame(?) (this would only work when you are inside only though) without having to change the locks/knob.

Buy a security camera (there's a nice wired Arlo camera but its $200). I would aim it at the entrance in plain view. Would probably scare the person away. Or at the very least if they decide to steal the camera you would have video evidence unless the power is out of course.  

Arlo also has a Wireless camera system. Comes with 3 camera's and you put batteries in them to work. You can place them inside and outside. It's around $350 I believe. It also records and you can watch from your phone. I'm pretty sure if your power goes out they will still record due to being run on batteries. However they probably still need to be on wifi or need wifi later to upload the videos online/to the app.

Also on Amazon there is a door alarm you put at the bottom of the door. If someone opens it it will trigger a screeching noise. But of course that only helps if you are inside the apartment.

&gt; Here are some ideas to shape future suburbs into smart, efficient and more sustainable places to live.

&gt; The plant-to-pavement ratio of today&amp;#039;s suburb is much higher than that of cities, but the next generation of suburbs can be even better at absorbing water.

&gt; In the near term, we should hope to see more efficient cars and on ride sharing.

themanalo37,,,,t2_r1ta5q5,"Developers generally figure out projected revenue returns through two aspects:

1) Comparable Product Analysis. Go look at Zillow and craigslist and try to find comparable housing arrangements to what you are offering and go from there. Bear in mind comparability factors such as parking, size, bed count, location, and local amenities and definitely ensure that what you are comparing with is student targetted housing. 

2) Land Residual Analysis. Once you have a projected revenue, you subtract costs of construction (or in your case purchase), transportation, utilities, etc. to arrive at the maximum land value that you should pay if you want to be profitable. 

These are not totally necessary steps since what you are doing is much smaller scale than say, a 300 unit apartment building, but if you want to cover any risks, these are very useful steps.",,1556012964,,,elk7mf8,t3_b5y97w,,t3_b5y97w,,1556012965.0,1,,housing,t5_2qh7e,,False,,,,False,True,/r/housing/comments/b5y97w/how_much_would_you_rent_a_tiny_home_for/elk7mf8/,True,,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",1556099361.0,,,,[],,,text,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,

Adisah,,,,t2_cizr6,"Making 1600 a month and then spending about 1350-1400 for rent is extremely tough. They most likely wouldn't let you pass the application process because most apartments require that you make 3x times the rent in gross (pre-tax) income.  


I'm not an expert or anything but I'll share with you some strategies I do know of. You could try living long term in an AirBnb.  [https://www.airbnb.com/sublets](https://www.airbnb.com/sublets) This would let you avoid the deposits and income requirements that most rentals have. You also wouldn't have to pay for water, electricity, or internet(most units include free wi-fi). There are discounts that are given for long term stays so don't be afraid of the initial per day cost. (Can sometimes be a discount of up to 70%) So it will bring the price down in line with a normal rental but you actually come out ahead of a traditional rental since you don't have to pay for utilities or furniture. Depending on how much stuff you have, you might have to get rid of some of your stuff or put it in storage. From what I read about it, you would pay month to month. You don't have to pay the entire stay up front.  [https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/245/how-do-i-pay-for-my-long-term-reservation](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/245/how-do-i-pay-for-my-long-term-reservation)   


Another option you have is Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist. You can search for a rental or sublet or a room. Unfortunately, this will require extensive vetting. You need to be careful to not get scammed. You typically want to avoid any rent to own opportunities unless it is done by a reputable company. Some listings are not real, try to search the address of the property to make sure it is real or see if there is a duplicate listing from another person.   


There are also other options like living in an RV or building your own tiny home but those require a lot of time, research, and effort.

  
Last resort would be living in your car. You could spend most of your time in free/low cost places such as libraries and coffee shops. You could get a gym membership and shower there but this would be more of a last resort.  


If you can eventually get a remote job on a site like weworkremotely, hitmakerjobs or from one of the many other remote job boards. You wouldn't be location dependent and would be able to easily move to lower cost of living states and cities -- or maybe even a different country if you're feeling the Digital Nomad vibe.

It's a month to month lease only for 960$ per month plus shared utilities (including SDGE, water, and internet). The deposit is only 250$. The leasing office asks you to show proof of income as well as the credit check. 
 It's a spacious bright room with lots of mirrored closets and storages. This duplex townhome has 1.5 bathroom so you will be sharing a bathroom, living room, kitchen, and a balcony. There is one bathroom upstairs + an extra 
 toilet downstairs. The location is perfect central, so it's close to anywhere in San Diego.

I'm a 27 years old clean, responsible, and easygoing girl. I'd love to find a mature, clean, and quiet FRIEND to share this lovely townhome. &lt;3

rowerbug,1503083765.0,,,t2_az7v8ld,"Is your dog an emotional support dog or a service dog? There's a big legal difference between the two. It sounds like you have an ESA but I'll clarify:

Emotional Support dogs receive no special training. They are only covered by the Fair Housing Act and the Air Carrier Access Act, so they are protected when travelling by air or in housing. They do not have special privileges in public, so they can't go into stores/malls/restaurants/etc. 

Service dogs are trained to perform a task that directly mitigates their handler's disability. They are covered by the Fair Housing Act, Air Carrier Access Act, and Americans with Disabilities Act. They have public-access rights as well as privileges in housing and air travel. 

If your animal is an ESA, per the Fair Housing Act, you must provide your landlord with a letter from a psychiatrist that actively treats you. It must state that you are disabled by a psychiatric condition and require the presence of the dog to mitigate that disability. Wait until you sign the contract and all the paperwork is finalized, but BEFORE you move in, and then send an accommodation request with a copy of the psychiatrist's letter. 

(There are lots of scam websites that sell certification/identification/etc. These have no legal bearing and your dog will not be protected under the FHA if you provide that instead of a letter)

drewalex274,1546250933.0,,,t2_2w7pl8wg,"Don't let your emotions play with you. The lower the prices you pay for a property, the better are the odds that you’ll earn a higher profit from it.

Do your research. Choose a fine location which could bring you a nice return when you have to sell it.

Secure a down payment as it’s the main area you have to focus on if you are buying the property on mortgage.

Calculate expenses and profits beforehand. Start with calculating the money that you already have and what you can borrow before buying your first investment property. 

Select a low-cost home as your first investment property. It is as if you have to spend money on renovation and maintenance before selling or renting it. This will make the property more expensive for you. 

Besides that, when you invest in your first investment property, you must keep your investment as low as possible. This will help you stay in the safe zone. In case, you don't hit the expected profits when you are going to sell it, you won't lose even.

Clear all your debts. You must get all your debts cleared before starting a new real estate project. If you have student loans, medical bills etc. on your shoulders, get it cleared.

Consider investment loan options. There are great numbers of options available in the market when it comes to collecting money to purchase your first property. Picking up the exact option that could make a positive difference to your financial situation requires a lot of research.",,1547796487,,,eec6na0,t3_a1ruto,,t3_a1ruto,,1547796487.0,1,,housing,t5_2qh7e,,False,,,,,True,/r/housing/comments/a1ruto/buying_my_first_property_advice_needed/eec6na0/,True,,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",1547796487.0,,,,[],,,text,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,
Suffolk1970,1532836928.0,,,t2_1vja0mej,"I agree, coming up with four months of rent is hard. It easily becomes about $10,000. Realtor's will some times (not always) lower their fee to a half month's rent, in May or June, because the big rental period here is starts September 1st, when nearly 100,000 college students move into the state and the Boston area in particular.  If you can, I strongly urge you to get your place before July and August - which is the hot season for getting housing here. 

I've lived in Boston for 50 years; as a tenant, homeowner, condo owner, and landlady. None of it is easy. Traffic is heavy, our infrastructure is old. Ideally, you'll want to live as close to your work as possible. Start from there. 

(I assume 2 jobs, so 2 commutes?) Get the map out, and look at all the towns around Boston. (Boston ""proper"" is only 20% of the area, which really includes Cambridge, Brookline, Malden, Medford, Everett, Chelsea, Revere, etc.) There is a lot of good public transportation, but the further out you go, the longer it takes.

djkinz,,,,t2_8b5m6,"So it might help for you to define what area you mean by Northeast, but I'll take a stab at this anyway from a Virginia native and North Carolina resident.

Charlottesville, VA (pop ~48,000) is 4.5 hours from Philadelphia while Richmond (pop ~227,000) is 4. Both have reasonable cost of living with a more laid back vibe than you'd find in the Northeast. Jobs are plentiful in Richmond but Charlottesville has more of the small town feel. I don't know that I would characterize either of them as having a ""Southern Feel"" but I've lived in both cities and both are great. 

I live in Durham, NC, which I also love, but it's a 4 hour drive to DC. If you're willing to venture that far, the Triangle (Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill) is low on traffic, great cost of living, and pockets of it absolutely have a southern vibe going on. There are other Southern towns and cities in between the Triangle and Richmond, but the only other one I would personally recommend is maybe Blacksburg.

[According to him](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hispanic/comments/dhc929/pew_research_hispanics_to_outpace_black_americans/), soccer games are evidence Mexicans are inherently anti-american:

&gt; “Just look around the stands you'll see tens of thousands of Hispanics many of them perhaps the majority of them American citizens rooting wildly cheering wildly for the Mexican team and booing and hissing when the American team takes the field.”

He claims Mexicans are separatists:

&gt; “That's why Mexicans are just part of an organization called for example National Council of La Raza La Raza meaning ‘The Race’. again the perspective is a very narrow one what's in it for our group what's in it for our race. Por La Raza todo, Fuera de La Raza nada!”

His comments later get even more deranged:

&gt; “Mexican children are taught in school that the Mexico/US border is invalid and they don't have to honor the border. Eventually, probably by 2100, California (minus key federal land such as military bases) will be part of Mexico as the political will, led by a predominate La Raza US Congress will allow it.”


[He's scared](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hispanic/comments/dkb4p5/hispanic_consciousness/) because Mexicans are trying to “reconquer” previously held Mexican territories (the south-western U.S.).

Scarmter,,,,t2_51wx0kpr,"Hey there! No worries with sounding dumb, we all started somewhere. I’m not 100% sure if you mean having roommates and your girlfriend live in your apartment, or having your girlfriend as your only roommate, but I’ll address the latter. 
Once you find an apartment you both like, you’ll most likely apply for a tour to check it out. During this time, you can ask questions about the lease- the written papers that explain your contract, like rent cost, whether you have to pay for water, electric, if there’s a curfew, what pets you can have... 
One of the questions you can ask is whether you should put both your names on the lease or just yours. If you do just your name, it’ll be your responsibility and everything will legally be yours, if you do both, you split that responsibility. Definitely tell the landlord or whoever you’re talking to if your girlfriend is living there full time. If she comes over once or twice a week you’re fine without saying anything, but you can get in trouble for having someone staying there long term without it documented.
As for rent, whatever the rent is, that’s the amount that gets paid every month. You can split it half and half or however you choose with your girlfriend. For example, the rent could be listed as 1000, so for two people living there, the cost would be 500 per person. That’s also why some people have a lOt if roommates. No one wants to share an apartment with three other people, but the more people you add, the more people that rent gets split between, so the lower it goes. 
So, I would try to make a budget and see how much you both can afford, then google apartments in ___ for rent,, and look at websites until you find something that looks good. The website will have contact information and you can call or apply to set up a tour.

DoreenMichele,,,,t2_z1nitqt,"You will need to find what local banks offer zero down loans. It will likely be a short list. These are not common.

Even if you find a zero down loan, you will still need to cover closing costs somehow. These can be substantial.

One possible solution to get in with genuinely no money up front: Find a motivated seller and ask them to cover the closing costs as part of your offer on the property. They will very likely tack this amount onto the price. If so, do not hesitate to yes at the higher price because it will be maybe $5 or $10 extra a month on the mortgage, but will let you get into a house with no funds up front.

You should do some research on the internet to start. For example, the USDA has a zero down mortgage program. It will still be handled by a bank, but you should start learning what programs are potentially available. The USDA site has a search function to see if your area is covered by their program:

**\/u/MandJtraveltogether**, -64 points

Tomorrow my roommate/tenant (I am the landlord) will be taking a 3 day trip where she'll be going through the airport both ways. She's flying from Texas to New York and back.

While she is gone, I will be changing all locks and disabling the garage door opener. I ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT allow her in the house for 2 weeks after she gets back. I will put some clothes in a bag for her and place that bag on the front porch, but I am not going to risk myself being exposed to a person who has just been through TWO international airports in the span of 3 days.

I will let her know about this tomorrow (after she takes off from her departure). She will definitely be upset, but I am not going to risk my life because of her selfish and irresponsible behavior. I begged and pleaded her not to go but she just said

\&gt; ""People are over reacting. I'll wash my hands and wear glasses and won't touch my face. I'll be fine.""

I cannot believe her. She is going to put me at a HUGE risk because she has some shitty job that's telling her to travel in this mess, and she's too cowardly to tell them 'no.' Well I'm not going to put up with it.

So when she gets back, what are the legal implications for this? We don't have an official lease so I can confidently tell the police that she doesn't live here and she's just some crazy woman. But what if the police actually believe her, or they start asking questions? Is there any legal protection for me as a landlord to eject dangerous tenants?

If worse comes worst well Texas is a Castle Doctrine state so if she tries breaking in will I be able to legally shoot her? I don't actually own a gun but I might go buy one tomorrow if I can.

EDIT: people keep asking why I don't tell her before she leaves. She is absolutely dead set on going, even if I tell her she will still go because it's mandatory for her job or something. But I'm afraid if I tell her then she will take some mail that's addressed to her at this house and use it to convince the police she lives here.

EDIT2: You all keep telling me ""she has tenants rights!"" She's only a tenant in name, THERE IS NO LEASE. It's all verbal agreement. I have rights too as a home owner/landlord. I can kick out dangerous individuals.

Semper-Aethereum,,,,t2_ys5n5,"House prices rise because millions of people want to buy a house, so the owner of the house (the seller) can raise his/her price tag for a buyer to purchase the home. S/he can do this because currently there are multiple prospective buyers for each home.                  

Buyers are willing to eat that loss and pay more because they want the home and its environment and they're scared of losing the house to another buyer who could potentially out-bid them.

nothalfas,,,,t2_141lkr,"Since my last advice landed well, here's some more:

I put 20% down, so I didn't have to pay PMI. How? I saved 5 or 10 percent myself, and: asked everyone who cared about me for help.  Help = 1-3 year loan for down.

My employer liked me so he chipped in 5k and docked repayment from my wages.

My dad kicked in a lot.  I repaid him over years.

The seller agreed to ""rent to buy"" - I paid him rent for a year. Then some small fraction of the rent he gave back as purchase credit.

Now's when I would ask anyone you know with money: godparents, older church friends, etc

Also!  Plan 6 months ahead to get the loan.  

1)  Banks want to see the down payment as an unencumbered liquid asset. not a loan. A gift from family.  Best kind is a cash deposit in a bank account in your name, with bank statements showing this cash has been there for several months before the date you officially apply for a loan. 

2) find a mortgage broker to fix it up. You can repair a lot of bad credit scores.  Everyone has some bad credit events, so no shame.

3) talk to a mortgage broker (ask a real estate agent to recommend one) and get pre-qualified early. 6 months prior.  Be honest. They're like your defense attorney.   They work for you, and help you put your best foot forward to the bank.   Fyi, the bank is the judge. Not your ally.  Be very careful what you tell them directly.  

Those are the main things I did right at your age to get a house.  

If the usual house buying advice is helpful, e.g. buy the worst house on the block, let me know.

And alas, personal values are usually whatever our parents did. If you break their mold, don't repeat their mistakes, then you are a legend and deserve huge praise.

 buy a house?  decide:

 what matters to you? Can't have it all of course.  Do your money choices reflect your core values?  

If you're partnered, what values do you share? Eg Education vs house vs travel.  Agree. In writing. 

Make a 10 year forecast for your current money income, expense, investment.  Does it enable your values?  If not, make a big life change.

make a plan to track your money behaviors. Maybe a tidy budget. Maybe a yelling argument every month with a partner.  Whatever keeps you paying attention.

When you go off track, eg big credit card spend, after the panic and coping, take a walk and diagnose why.  Get to the root cause.  What mistakes did your parents make? Use your anger to change yourself.  what ironbound rules are you using to avoid repeating their mistakes?

Take California. These elderly people tend to be NIMBYs who have been fabricating homeless like there's no tomorrow. Just in Los Angeles, they make 2,000 homeless each year that rents go up by 5% (notably under the new cap that's supposed to protect renters). In the US, the longevity of the homeless is just 43 and 47 for women and men respectively. A ton of the newly made homeless are families with kids.

So I wouldn't take for granted that if a big number of NIMBYs die, overall in the decade more lives could actually be saved through having better access to housing.

So it's not just the added house that becomes part of the inventory. Is the lower number of those who oppose the construction of new housing, notably, multi-family housing which could end up benefiting society long-term.

It would be better to compare the change in population of New York with the total number of new units constructed.

Then there's all the other things to consider. First, subtract the number of units demolished to create the new housing.

Also, consider changing demographics. Is the average number of people per home decreasing in New York as units get smaller and the city becomes dominated by young urbanites? Hence a need for more units even if population remained constant?

Is New York known for having a lot of vacant units owned by foreigners? The units may be vacant much of the time but this wouldn't mean they are available for others to live in, even if population remained constant.

river-wind,,,,t2_27vr5,"That’s item 1 in the article.  If the demand isn’t high enough to keep the place occupied, then lowering the price will be the simplest way to compete against other available rentals in the area.

And just like when selling a house, there are things that can be done to increase the likelihood of finding a customer in addition to adjusting the price.  Things like having good photos can be a huge step in getting someone to even consider an apartment or house.  I know when I’m looking for a new place, really bad photos make me think “if they couldn’t even bother to clean up the kitchen for the photos, what other things haven’t they done?”

These are useful for renters to be aware of too.  If you’d only looking on Trulia, Craigslist, and Zillow, you may miss out on good finds to be had on other sites.  Do a comparison with similar properties ahead of time to know how much rent you should expect to pay before you talk with the owner/rental agent.  Don’t get tricked by faked photos that are too good to be true.

I asked if I could look at the house for a tour, and he claimed he'd be out of town for months, but he'd send me pictures of the interior.

I went to the property on my own, and there was no sign up indicating it was for rent. It was still fully furnished... 

I looked up the address online and found results for the actual owner.

The house wasn't for rent. The property had been bought 5 years before by someone who had no idea what I was talking about.

You are a student, and have your own loans.  Your money should be going to pay those loans.  Your parents should be able to qualify for a variety of FHA programs, even if they can’t qualify for a standard 20% down loan.

For example, there is the FHA 203b loan option which may be better than a standard FHA loan.  In that case, an applicant with a credit score above 580 can get a loan with as little at 3.5% down, and that down payment can come as a gift from a family member, without the need to co-sign.  If your parents only have a credit score above 500, they could get a down payment as low as 10%, which may be enough to avoid needing you to co-sign.

 If your parents don’t have a credit score above 500, then that needs to be addressed before they try to buy a house.  Keep in mind that owning a house requires budgeting for regular maintenance, repairs and unexpected expenses; failure to do that can mean potentially losing money, or even losing the house.

Depending on the average income level for your area, your parents could also qualify for a HomeReady loan, with as little as 3% down.  In this case, you also don’t need to co-sign, but if you are living at home and have any sort of part time income, that can be used in the paperwork as apart of the household income total.  This program is designed for lower-income situations, so there is a cut-off if your parents earn more than the average for the area.

There’s also the Conventional 97 for first time home buyers, which is a more standard loan, but can finance up to 97% of the mortgage.

https://www.rubyhome.com/blog/conventional-97-low-downpayment-mortgage/

All of these options come with the dreaded PMI, or insurance payments added to the mortgage because the down payment is less than 20%.  As soon as the mortgage falls below 20% of the current market value of the house, you will likely want to refinance to a standard mortgage.

There are Lots of options.  If the issue is credit scores, then the 203b can help.  If it’s up front cash, other options are available.   If the house they are interested in needs some minor repairs, the 203k can work, if they plan on occupying the property themselves.",,1581398315,,,fha6595,t3_f23958,,t3_f23958,,1581398317.0,1,,housing,t5_2qh7e,,False,,,,False,True,/r/housing/comments/f23958/using_my_refund_check_on_a_house/fha6595/,True,,{},,,,,[],,,text,,,[],False,False,0.0,,,False,[],,,,,

TobySomething,,,,t2_oqw5o,"I mean, yeah, tons of people do this.

Until I got married I was living in LA with an extra roommate in a partitioned off area of my living room.

My brother bought a property in Venice and there were like 10 people living in a 1-2 bedroom house.

When I lived in San Francisco I had to be off lease because it was restricted how many people were allowed to live in each apartment (even though we all had our own rooms, SF's restrictions are insane).

In terms of rebuilding your house, I think if you actually wanted to expand a single family home to fit the absolute farthest corners of your property, you would probably need a construction permit and it would likely be denied or you would get sued by someone in your neighborhood under CEQA, an environmental quality law that has been routinely abused to block construction that people don't want in their neighborhoods. 

Part of the new SB50 law that is proposed and will hopefully pass allows homes to be remodeled into 4-plexes as long as they are not torn down. But we will see, there is a lot of blowback from NIMBY groups.

Even if it doesn't, I think you could certainly cram a lot of people into a single family home - and people do - but many people who can afford a single family home to begin with don't want to cram a ton of people in there, and obviously doing so can create tensions especially if there aren't locked doors and privacy.",,1580179752,,,ffsehmn,t3_euw3i7,,t3_euw3i7,,1580179753.0,1,,housing,t5_2qh7e,,False,,,,False,True,/r/housing/comments/euw3i7/why_not_share_housing/ffsehmn/,True,,{},,,,,[],,,text,,,[],False,False,0.0,,,True,[],,,,,

golden_slumlord,,,,t2_1554oy,"Hello!

I currently own large amount of on frame modular homes/ manufactured/ double wide which ever the name that were built in 1995. The ones on a permanent foundation! No wheels no tongue. Anyway. Just for some back ground there. I’ve been renting them out for about 15 years in a low rent area for the most part. And a few in a pretty decent area. I’ll say for the bang for the buck idea, they are fantastic homes. Super great mind you. Depending on how well they have performed is imo based on the quality of the material installed in the home when it was assembled. Some used the cheapest particle board sub flooring, CPVC(I don’t think anyone uses this anymore) water supply piping, and cheap cabinets which in turn over the years with EXTREMELY rough tenants. Did not hold up great. Where as a lot of the homes have a better osb sub flooring( plywood being best) and pex piping, these have held up a lot better. Which leads me to say, I tell most people that water is our biggest threat. Whether it be inside water from supply lines or drains, or from windows and roof. Fix the water issues and the house is solid. I mentioned that I have a few in a better part of town that has always had good tenants who take care of the home. That house after 25 years is still all original except carpet and paint. I have never repaired anything major in that house and it is all due to people just living in it as people should live in homes. Not tearing doors off hinges or ripping cabinets out punching holes, breaking windows ect.

I would 100% recommend a modular home to anyone looking for a better bang for buck idea. Have it assembled with better sub flooring, solid wood cabinets, and pex piping, and I would say that place will last you a lifetime without issue. Also now I’m thinking of things I’d do different. Double pane single hung windows and see if you can get standard house sized doors. 

Hope it wasn’t a jumbled ramble on mess.

SERIOUSLY pm me if you have questions. I have seen, and repaired about everything on one of these things. I KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT THEM TO NOT HELP
